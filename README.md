# Spaced

Spaced is a super simple and convenient way to isolate and namespace a collection of related methods into any class.

## Usage

```ruby
class User
  include Spaced

  # Pass a block with a bunch of methods.
  namespace :twitter do
    def create(msg)
      api.create_tweet msg
    end

    def read(id)
      api.read_tweet id
    end

    private

      def api
        @api ||= TwitterClient.new(api_token: parent.api_token)
      end
  end

  # Or pass a predefined class, which should subclass `Spaced::Base`.
  namespace :facebook, Facebook::Api
end

user = User.new
id = user.twitter.create("Spaced man!")
user.twitter.read(id)
```

In the example above, `namespace` creates and initializes a new class `Twitter` and returns it from the `#twitter` method. The parent class - in this case `User` - is available at `#parent` and `@parent` from within the namespace.

## Magic bang and predicate methods

If you define a `#_!` or `#call` method in your namespaced class, you can then conveniently call that with a bang method:

```ruby
class User
  include Spaced

  namespace :tweet do
    def _!(content)
      create_tweet content
    end
  end
end

user = User.new
user.tweet!('my new tweet') # Will call the `#_!` method with whatever arguments you give it.
```

There is also an equivalent predicate method:

```ruby
namespace :tweet do
  def _?
    false
  end
end
user = User.new
user.tweet? # Will call the `#predicate` method.
```

Both bang and predicate methods can be defined using identically named methods:

```ruby
namespace :tweet do
  def tweet?
    false
  end

  def tweet!
    # ...
  end
end
user = User.new
user.tweet? # Will call the `#tweet?` method on `:tweet` namespace.
user.tweet! # Will call the `#tweet!` method on `:tweet` namespace.
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spaced'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
